*Open CV (Computer Vision) solutions for Roblox*

## Background ##

I have always wanted to get into computer vision combined with AI and I think I might be able to learn something out of this, who knows?

### What has been done so far? ###

I am done with the main foundation of the software.
Now I will be upgrading it and add more features. I will also try to remember to update this Readme so that people that are interested can track my progress. Fun

What's completed:

- [x] Screen Capture  
- [x] Line Detection

### How to install and why Python? ###

Unfortunately Python is the best language for machine learning. That's the only reason lol. How to install: 

* [Download Python](www.python.org)

* Run the script and the **first time** it will install all the necessary libraries for you. Just wait until it's finished and enjoy.

*(Please note that this script **should** work on linux and mac OS, but I haven't tested it)*
